# Project Overview

I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) was already included, as was the starter code for the first tests. My task was to complete the project.



# How to Run

1. You can download or clone this repository.
2. Find the index.html file, and open the file in a modern browser.
3. The Jasmine tests are displayed at the bottom of the index.html page.
4. Open the jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file to start editing the test suites.
